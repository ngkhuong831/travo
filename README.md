    Traveling to new places is harsh, book a tour-guided trip would involves a traveling schedule that may not fit your physical condition, visiting places you are not interested in,... while traveling alone is a pain due to the excessive amount of research from all sources about what to do, where to go, what may interests you and what not,...Travo is a full-stack application developed to solve that problem, built as a mobile app functioning based on a self-built API which contains categorized information about tourist attractions all around Viet Nam.
